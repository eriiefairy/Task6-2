What is Web 3.0 and how is it different from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0?

Web 3.0, also known as the Semantic Web or the Intelligent Web, refers to the vision of a more advanced and intelligent version of the World Wide Web. While there
isn't a universally agreed-upon definition or a specific set of technologies associated with Web 3.0, it generally represents the next evolution of the web that
focuses on adding more meaning and context to information and enhancing the capabilities of online interactions.

Here are the key differences between Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0:

Web 1.0:
Web 1.0, also called the "Read-Only Web," refers to the early days of the internet when the web was primarily a collection of static web pages with
limited interactivity. In this phase, websites were mostly informational, and users could only consume content without much contribution or interaction. Websites
were mainly designed for one-way communication from the website owner to the users.

Web 2.0:
Web 2.0, known as the "Read-Write Web," represents the era of interactive and user-generated content. It introduced dynamic and collaborative elements
to the web, enabling users to create, share, and interact with content. Web 2.0 introduced social media platforms, blogging, wikis, and other interactive services
where users could actively participate, generate content, and connect with others. The focus was on user engagement, social interaction, and user-generated content.

Web 3.0:
Web 3.0 is envisioned as the "Semantic Web" that aims to make web content more meaningful and interconnected. It involves the use of technologies like
artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, and linked data to provide more intelligent and context-aware web experiences. Web 3.0
focuses on enhancing data integration, data sharing, and interoperability between different platforms and applications. It aims to enable machines to understand
and interpret web content, allowing for more personalized and relevant user experiences. Web 3.0 also emphasizes decentralized technologies, blockchain, and
cryptocurrencies to provide greater privacy, security, and control over data.



What are the functional differences between the front-end of a web application and its back-end?

Front-end:

User Interface: The front-end is responsible for creating the user interface (UI) that users interact with. It includes designing and developing the visual layout,
components, and features that users see and interact with on the web application.
User Experience: The front-end focuses on providing a seamless and intuitive user experience (UX). It involves optimizing the UI for usability, responsiveness,
accessibility, and performance to ensure a positive interaction between the user and the application.
Client-side Logic: The front-end handles client-side logic, which runs on the user's device or browser. This includes validating user inputs, handling user
interactions, and rendering dynamic content.
Presentation Layer: The front-end is responsible for presenting data and information to the user in a visually appealing and understandable manner. It formats and
structures the content to make it easily consumable by the user.

Back-end:

Server-side Logic: The back-end handles server-side logic, which runs on the web server or application server. It processes requests from the front-end, retrieves
data from databases or external APIs, performs calculations or manipulations, and generates appropriate responses.
Data Storage and Management: The back-end deals with data storage and management. It includes creating and maintaining databases, handling data persistence,
ensuring data integrity, and implementing data access mechanisms.
Business Logic: The back-end implements the business rules and logic of the web application. It performs complex calculations, processes user inputs, enforces
security measures, and executes algorithms or workflows.
Integration: The back-end integrates with external systems, services, or APIs to fetch data or perform specific operations. It handles data exchange,
authentication, and communication with external resources.



Explain the process that takes place from when you type a URL into the address bar in your browser until you finally view the page you have requested

The process from typing a URL into the address bar until viewing the requested page involves several steps.

DNS Resolution:
The browser extracts the domain name from the URL (e.g., "example.com").
The browser checks its cache for the corresponding IP address. If found, it proceeds to the next step. Otherwise, it sends a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup
request to the operating system.

DNS Lookup:
The operating system sends the DNS lookup request to a DNS resolver.
The DNS resolver checks its cache for the IP address. If found, it returns the IP address to the operating system. Otherwise, it performs iterative or
recursive queries to find the IP address associated with the domain name.
Once the IP address is obtained, it is returned to the operating system.

Establishing a Connection:
The browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the server using the obtained IP address and the default port 80 for HTTP or port
443 for HTTPS.
The browser and the server perform a TCP handshake to establish a reliable connection.

Sending HTTP Request:
The browser sends an HTTP request to the server.
The request includes the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST), the requested resource (e.g., "/index.html"), headers (such as user-agent, cookies), and other relevant
information.

Processing the Request on the Server:
The server receives the HTTP request.
The server processes the request based on the requested resource and any server-side logic associated with it.
The server may interact with databases, execute scripts, or perform other operations to generate the response.

Generating the Response:
The server generates an HTTP response.
The response includes a status code (e.g., 200 for success), headers (such as content-type, cache-control), and the response body (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or
other content).

Sending the Response:
The server sends the HTTP response back to the browser over the established TCP connection.
Receiving and Rendering the Page:
The browser receives the response from the server.
The browser processes the response, parses the HTML, renders the page structure, and applies CSS styles.
The browser may execute JavaScript code embedded in the page, which can manipulate the page's elements or make additional requests.
Displaying the Page:
The browser displays the fully rendered web page in its window or tab.
The user can interact with the displayed page, click links, submit forms, and perform other actions.
